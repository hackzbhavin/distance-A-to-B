# distance-A-to-B

- Finding distance from A to B on map
- Created a web-application to calculate the distance between two locations on the map. Used libraries like Folium for plotting maps and also used Geopy(python client) to locate coordinates and find country, states, cities, etc. 
Responsibilities: Worked as a Solo for self improvement

Folium is a Python library used for visualizing geospatial data. It is easy to use and yet a powerful library. Folium is a Python wrapper for Leaflet.js which is a leading open-source JavaScript library for plotting interactive maps.

--------
Why GeoPy
--------
- https://pypi.org/project/geopy/
>
geopy is a Python client for several popular geocoding web services.
geopy makes it easy for Python developers to locate the coordinates of addresses, cities, countries, and landmarks across the globe using third-party geocoders and other data sources.

>
MaxMind's GeoIP2 Databases provide IP intelligence data for high volume environments. By hosting our databases locally, you eliminate any network latency and per-query charges.
Inshort it help to locate states,city,country,ip-address location to calculate distance between 2 end points.
